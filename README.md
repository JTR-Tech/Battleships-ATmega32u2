"Battleships" game for the UCFK - ENCE260

For the assignment we have created the classic battleships game for the UCFK.
We believed the limiting factor of this device to be the rather small LED matrix,
to work around this we have implemented a 2d scrolling arena using a rudimentary
framebuffer we are able achieve a much more interesting game than the UCFK would
otherwise be limited to.
